# coding-events-1

The purpose of the app is to provide a list of upcoming coding events and allow people to register for them and keep track of them.

Currently, people can see coding events and their categories. They can choose to view them by All or by categoryId. 

I would like to add a feature where people can sign up, keep a calendar of events they are registered for/interested in, and see other people that are interested in the same events.
